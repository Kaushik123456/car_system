				<h2>HEALTH PREDICTION SYSTEM</h2><br>
				<p>Researchers all over the world are working in either multi agents or in ontologies for developing system in health care domain. It might have happenedso many times that you or someone need doctor help but they are not available due to some reason. The health management system is an end user support and online consultation project which use classification algorithms in data mining. Here we propose a system that allows users to get guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health care online system. The system is fed with various symptoms and the illness associated with those systems and the classification algorithms helps us in extracting the related disease associated with those systems from database.The system also gives the nearest doctor who is specalised in handling those type of diseases so that patient can contact or visit the hospital directly or the patient can also take advice from doctor in online.  <br>
